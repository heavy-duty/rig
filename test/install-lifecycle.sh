# the repo whose headline claim is convergence, ran nowhere:
#
#   1. install from THIS checkout      (RIG_INSTALL_SOURCE — the local channel)
#   2. assert what landed              (layout, current, the PATH chain)
#   3. a converging re-run             (an EMPTY DIFF, never an exit code)

# them in the environment cli.sh deliberately fakes — the real default paths
# under the runner's own $HOME. Run: bash test/install-lifecycle.sh (CI's
# `install:` job). RIG_HOME/RIG_BIN redirect the roots for a local run; the
# refusal below explains when you need them.

# Deliberately no `set -e` — a failing beat is data, and the summary is the
# verdict (the test/release.sh harness shape).
