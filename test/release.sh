# --- the arming rule: is main's changelog ready for a late merge? ------------
# #66: stamping the Unreleased heading DISARMS the file. A PR authored before
# a release and merged after it wrote its entry under `## Unreleased`; once
# that heading has become `## X.Y.Z — date`, git lands the entry under the
# release that already shipped — cleanly, no conflict, nothing for the author
# to notice. It happened here: #60's #58 entry landed inside `## 0.1.0` at
# 67386b4, repaired two minutes later by 0ff520c.
#
# The check above cannot see this, and #44 is why: demanding a literal
# `## Unreleased` is FALSE BY CONSTRUCTION on the tree the ceremony's own PR
# produces, which made the release PR unshippable. That relaxation must not
# be undone.
#
# What distinguishes the two states the old guard collapsed is VERSION.
# A stamped top section is legal exactly when VERSION is bare — the ceremony
# PR, and main until the -dev bump lands. The moment VERSION carries -dev,
# main is a place feature PRs merge into, and the top section MUST be
# `## Unreleased` or the next late merge is misfiled.
#
# Note the asymmetry, which is deliberate: on a BARE version the top heading
# is not constrained at all. The ceremony re-arms in the same PR
# (CONTRIBUTING step 1), so its tree legitimately carries an EMPTY
# `## Unreleased` above the section it just stamped — and an empty top
# section is exactly what the old non-empty assert would have rejected.
# What must extract non-empty on a bare VERSION is the section that SHIPS,
# which is the same assert release.yml makes before it publishes.

# --- the drill rule: does the version being shipped have a record? ----------

# other ceremony step is checked by a script, and the one that costs an
# afternoon was checked by a reviewer remembering. A bot finally blocked on it.
#
# Fixtures carry their OWN VERSION and RUNS.md, inside the fixture dir. This is
# not tidiness — it is heavy-duty/box#146, verbatim: fixtures that read the
# REPO's VERSION exercised the `-dev` branch on every ordinary tree, so the
# whole bare-version half of the guard was untested and went red for the first
# time while somebody was cutting a release. A fixture must state the tree it
# is about.
