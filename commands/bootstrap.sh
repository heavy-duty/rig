usage: rig bootstrap <control-plane|workload|runner|staging|dev|workstation|custom>
                     [--hostname <name>] [--class <human|server>]
                     [--host <yes|no>] [--join <authkey|login>]

  --hostname  system + tailnet hostname (default: the role name; custom has
              no default and requires it)
  --class     who lives here — human|server. Decides root SSH's fate after
              `rig users apply`: human closes it, server keeps it as the
              control plane's automation door.
  --host      does this box host VMs (box/Incus) — yes|no
  --join      how it enters the tailnet — authkey|login

Roles are presets over the three traits; any flag overrides its trait.
custom presets nothing and requires --hostname plus all three traits.

  role            class   host  join
  control-plane   server  no    authkey
  workload        server  no    authkey
  runner          server  no    authkey
  staging         server  yes   authkey
  dev             human   yes   authkey
  workstation     human   yes   login

The tailnet tag is NOT a rig argument. A pre-auth key is minted WITH its tags,
so the key is the single source of truth: rig no longer requests a tag it might
disagree with. After the box joins, rig reads the tag control actually GRANTED
(tailscale status .Self.Tags) and asserts on THAT — an untagged key is refused
outright, and only control-plane and workload may carry tag:server (they are
the only shapes the control plane manages). Mint a correctly-tagged key.

join=authkey: provide the single-use tailscale pre-auth key via the TS_AUTHKEY
env var, or enter it at the interactive prompt. Used once, never written to disk.

join=login: no pre-auth key — `tailscale up` prints a login URL and the human
at the keyboard is the credential, so the node comes up user-owned and
UNTAGGED (a tag here is refused and backed out). A set TS_AUTHKEY is a usage
error: unset it, or pass --join authkey.

# --- box install (host-class only) -------------------------------------------
# A host=yes box exists to run guest boxes, so bootstrap finishes the job rather
# than printing a to-do: it installs the box CLI globally and lets box's OWN
# setup-host build the Incus stack. Placed AFTER the role marker write on
# purpose — a box that failed to become what it claims (tag refused, join backed
# out) dies above and never reaches here, so box is never installed on top of a
# half-built host.
#
# rig DELEGATES to box; it never touches Incus itself. This is the same design
# law `rig users apply` enforces — "rig NEVER installs Incus: box's setup-host
# owns the daemon and its group." rig does not apt-install incus, does not
# configure the daemon, does not create the incus group. It runs BOX'S global
# installer as root, and box installs Incus via its setup-host. Two tools
# converging one daemon is drift by construction; box is the single owner.
#
# CONVERGENT: box's installer is a no-op when box is already installed — it says
# so and changes nothing — so re-running bootstrap is safe and cheap.
#
# OPT-OUT: RIG_SKIP_BOX_INSTALL=1 skips the whole step (a container rehearsal
# with no /dev/kvm, an offline box, or a host whose box you manage by hand). The
# step ALSO skips gracefully — with a warning pointing at the manual command —
# when curl is missing or the network is down: bootstrap's core job is OS
# hardening + the tailnet, and box is the host EXTRA, so a failed box install
# must never abort a bootstrap that otherwise fully succeeded.
#
# PIN POINTS: BOX_REPO / BOX_REF override the source (default heavy-duty/box@main).
# BOX_YES=1 makes box's installer non-interactive AND keeps setup-host (so the
# Incus stack is actually built, not just the CLI dropped on PATH).
#
# rig#12's hard constraints hold here: the HOST joined the tailnet above; the
# guest boxes never do (box does not join the tailnet — fine), and there are no
# credentials on the host (box is creds-free — fine).
#
# DEPENDENCY (box#71): the GLOBAL, world-readable install path — box under
# /opt/box with a /usr/local/bin shim that every non-root user can read — depends
# on box PR #71. Until that merges, box's root install lands in /root and non-root
# users cannot reach it, so this step is only fully correct once box#71 is merged.

      # its own effective-state verdict as `box doctor`, so the success line
      # hands the operator that verb instead of half-reimplementing it here.
