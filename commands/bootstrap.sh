                     (the box TENANT roles — see their own --help; they take
                      no --users, see below)

  --users     the users file this box's operators come from — REQUIRED. It is
              applied as bootstrap's last phase, exactly as `rig users apply
              --file <path>` would, so one command leaves a box with its
              people on it. Passed per invocation and never persisted.
  --no-users  the deliberate opt-out — bootstrap converges the OS and the
              tailnet and leaves the box with root as its only door.
  --hostname  system + tailnet hostname (default: the role name; custom has
              no default and requires it)
  --root-door what happens to root SSH after the users phase — closed|open.
              closed: `rig users close-root` shuts it once named operators can
              get in. open: it stays, as the control plane's automation door.
              (Named --class human|server before #77 — same trait, renamed for
              what it decides rather than for who lives on the box. Markers
              written by the old flag are still read.)
  --host      does this box host VMs (box/Incus) — yes|no
  --join      how it enters the tailnet — authkey|login

One of --users/--no-users is required on every role, root-door=open included:
a box nobody logs into routinely is exactly where shared-root access rots,
and per-human accounts keep attribution intact for the times someone does go
in. So the complete path is the default path and skipping it is a deliberate
--no-users, not an omission.

--users does NOT reach the box TENANT roles (claude-box|codex-box|grok-box|kimi-box|staging-box). A
tenant is a box-minted GUEST: box auto-runs its bootstrap at mint,
non-interactively, with no file to hand it; the guest never joins the tailnet
and has no SSH door of its own — entry is `box shell`, gated by the HOST's
incus grants, which the host's own users file already converged. A fleet-wide
operator file has nothing to converge in there.

Roles are presets over the three traits; any flag overrides its trait.
custom presets nothing and requires --hostname plus all three traits.

  role                   root-door  host  join
  control-plane-server   open       no    authkey
  workload-server        open       no    authkey
  runner-server          open       no    authkey
  staging-server         open       yes   authkey
  dev-server             closed     yes   authkey
  workstation            closed     yes   login

THE SUFFIX NAMES THE FAMILY, not the door policy. '-server' means this role builds a
fleet MACHINE — a tailnet node rig converges; '-box' (the tenant roles) means a
GUEST a box mints. Two families lived in one flat namespace and nothing in a
name said which you were asking for; 'staging' made that concrete by naming
both the metal and the guests on it.

  custom       no suffix: it presets nothing and can be any shape, a guest
               included, so a family claim would be one it cannot make.
  workstation  no suffix: somebody's own device, not fleet infrastructure —
               it joins by interactive login and comes up user-owned and
               untagged, and the tailnet never manages it.

'dev-server --root-door closed' says what is true and says it once: the suffix
names the FAMILY (a fleet machine), the trait names the DOOR (operators enter a
dev box as themselves, so 'users close-root' shuts its door). Until #77 this
trait was '--class human|server', which named the wrong axis — who lives on the
box — and left 'dev-server' reading as a class=human contradiction. Nobody
lives on a dev box; what makes it different is that its root door closes.

The tailnet tag is NOT a rig argument. A pre-auth key is minted WITH its tags,
so the key is the single source of truth: rig no longer requests a tag it might
disagree with. After the box joins, rig reads the tag control actually GRANTED
(tailscale status .Self.Tags) and asserts on THAT — an untagged key is refused
outright, and only control-plane-server and workload-server may carry
tag:server (they are the only shapes the control plane manages). Mint a
correctly-tagged key.

join=authkey: provide the single-use tailscale pre-auth key via the TS_AUTHKEY
env var, or enter it at the interactive prompt. Used once, never written to disk.

join=login: no pre-auth key — `tailscale up` prints a login URL and the human
at the keyboard is the credential, so the node comes up user-owned and
UNTAGGED (a tag here is refused and backed out). A set TS_AUTHKEY is a usage
error: unset it, or pass --join authkey.

# --- box install (host=yes only) -------------------------------------------
# A host=yes box exists to run guest boxes, so bootstrap finishes the job rather
# than printing a to-do: it installs the box CLI globally and lets box's OWN
# setup-host build the Incus stack. Placed AFTER the role marker write on
# purpose — a box that failed to become what it claims (tag refused, join backed
# out) dies above and never reaches here, so box is never installed on top of a
# half-built host.
#
# rig DELEGATES to box; it never touches Incus itself. This is the same design
# law `rig users apply` enforces — "rig NEVER installs Incus: box's setup-host
# owns the daemon and its group." rig does not apt-install incus, does not
# configure the daemon, does not create the incus group. It runs BOX'S global
# installer as root, and box installs Incus via its setup-host. Two tools
# converging one daemon is drift by construction; box is the single owner.
#
# CONVERGENT: box's installer is a no-op when box is already installed — it says
# so and changes nothing — so re-running bootstrap is safe and cheap.
#
# OPT-OUT: RIG_SKIP_BOX_INSTALL=1 skips the whole step (a container rehearsal
# with no /dev/kvm, an offline box, or a host whose box you manage by hand). The
# step ALSO skips gracefully — with a warning pointing at the manual command —
# when curl is missing or the network is down: bootstrap's core job is OS
# hardening + the tailnet, and box is the host EXTRA, so a failed box install
# must never abort a bootstrap that otherwise fully succeeded.
#
# PIN POINTS: BOX_REPO / BOX_REF override the source (default
# heavy-duty/box@0.9.0). BOX_RELEASE is bumped deliberately when rig releases,
# after the pinned combination has passed the release drill.
# BOX_YES=1 makes box's installer non-interactive AND keeps setup-host (so the
# Incus stack is actually built, not just the CLI dropped on PATH).
#
# rig#12's hard constraints hold here: the HOST joined the tailnet above; the
# guest boxes never do (box does not join the tailnet — fine), and there are no
# credentials on the host (box is creds-free — fine).
#
# DEPENDENCY (box#71): the GLOBAL, world-readable install path — box under
# /opt/box with a /usr/local/bin shim that every non-root user can read — depends
# on box PR #71. Until that merges, box's root install lands in /root and non-root

# --- users (the last phase, and it must be last) -------------------------------

# what an absent incus group means (refuse on yes, skip the box role with a
# warning on no). Run before the marker write, apply would see no marker at all
# and warn "re-run rig bootstrap so this box knows what it is" — in the middle
# of the very bootstrap that is teaching it. Run before the box install, a
# host=yes box would refuse its own box-role users for a group arriving twenty
# lines later. So: traits, then join, then marker, then box, then people.
#
# NOT persisted. rig takes the path, reads it once through apply, and keeps
# nothing — the users file lives in your private infra repo and is passed per
# invocation (README: "rig never persists it"). Taking it as a bootstrap flag
# must not quietly turn it into box state, so nothing here copies it anywhere,
# and /etc/rig keeps only the ledger of NAMES apply already wrote.
#
# Invoked as a child, not exec'd: bootstrap still owns the last word (the
# next-steps below), and a failing apply must fail the bootstrap — under
# `set -e` a non-zero apply ends the run right here, which is correct. The box
# is already hardened and joined at this point; what failed is one named phase,
# and it is re-runnable on its own with `rig users apply --file <path>`.
#
# A child also keeps apply's INVOKER gate intact, which is the point: SUDO_USER
# rides through, so `sudo rig bootstrap --users <file-naming-me-admin>` by a
# role-rig user refuses exactly as `sudo rig users apply` would. Bootstrap must
