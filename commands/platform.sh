# Read-only in the strongest sense rig has: it reads /proc, uname,

# NOTHING, ever. That
# is the design, not an implementation detail — specs change without rig doing
# anything (RAM added, root disk resized, unattended-upgrades patching the
# kernel), so a stored spec is stale the moment the machine changes, and
# refreshing one on every run would collide with bootstrap's convergence
# contract ("safe to re-run; a second run changes nothing").
#
# The corollary is worth having deliberately: this runs on a machine rig has
# never converged, and needs no root. It answers "what should I converge this
# into?", not only "what did I converge this into?".

usage: rig platform

Describes the machine you are on: hostname, a stable machine ID, OS, kernel,
CPU, memory, disk and virtualization, then rig's own provenance (which rig,
when, and the role marker bootstrap wrote).

ID names the machine where HOSTNAME names the slot: it is derived from
/etc/machine-id (a namespaced sha256, never the raw value, which machine-id(5)
asks tools not to expose). Two machines reporting the same ID were cloned
from one image — actionable information, not a coincidence: no identity that
lives in the filesystem survives the filesystem being copied.

Computed at run time from /proc, uname, /etc/os-release, /etc/machine-id, df
and systemd-detect-virt. Writes nothing, needs no root, makes no network call
— so it also works on a pristine Debian box rig has never bootstrapped, where
the provenance block reads 'not bootstrapped'.

# --- identity (#95) -----------------------------------------------------------
# HOSTNAME names the slot; ID names the machine. rig itself sets the hostname
# during bootstrap and reuses it across rebuilds ('hetzner-cp-1' is a role, not
# hardware), so nothing above answers "is this the same machine I converged in
# June, or its replacement?". /etc/machine-id does — but machine-id(5) asks
# that the raw value not be exposed (it is a stable correlator across every
# tool that leaks it), and its documented remedy is an application-specific
# derivation. So: THE PINNED DERIVATION, fixed by #95 so two implementations
# can never disagree —
#
#   printf 'rig-machine-id:%s' "$(cat /etc/machine-id)" | sha256sum
#   → first 32 hex chars, rendered 8-4-4-4-12
#
# The 'rig-machine-id:' prefix is the contract, not decoration: it is what
# keeps this id uncorrelatable with any other tool's derivation of the same
# machine-id. sha256sum is coreutils, which this command is restricted to.
# Derived, computed here, stored nowhere — #64's thesis — so it exists before
# bootstrap and needs no write path.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT fix: a host cloned from a golden image
# carries the clone's /etc/machine-id, so two machines reporting the same ID
# means a cloned image. That is surfaced (help text, README) rather than
# defended against — no identity that lives in the filesystem survives the
