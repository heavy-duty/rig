# rig platform — what is this machine? Calculated at run time, stored nowhere.
#
# Read-only in the strongest sense rig has: it reads /proc, uname,
# /etc/os-release, df and systemd-detect-virt, and writes NOTHING, ever. That
# is the design, not an implementation detail — specs change without rig doing
# anything (RAM added, root disk resized, unattended-upgrades patching the
# kernel), so a stored spec is stale the moment the machine changes, and
# refreshing one on every run would collide with bootstrap's convergence
# contract ("safe to re-run; a second run changes nothing").
#
# The corollary is worth having deliberately: this runs on a machine rig has
# never converged, and needs no root. It answers "what should I converge this
# into?", not only "what did I converge this into?".

usage: rig platform

Describes the machine you are on: hostname, OS, kernel, CPU, memory, disk
and virtualization, then rig's own provenance (which rig, when, and the role
marker bootstrap wrote).

Computed at run time from /proc, uname, /etc/os-release, df and
systemd-detect-virt. Writes nothing, needs no root, makes no network call —
so it also works on a pristine Debian box rig has never bootstrapped, where
the provenance block reads 'not bootstrapped'.

# /etc/rig/manifest is #61 and is NOT implemented yet, so on every machine in
# existence today this block reads 'not bootstrapped'. That degradation is the
# point: the two features are independent and neither blocks the other. The
# parse is the flat key=value shape the manifest is specified to use — the
# same jq-free shape /etc/rig/users and /etc/rig/role already use, parseable
# with `read` on a box that has no YAML parser.
#
# RIG_MANIFEST / RIG_ROLE_MARKER override the paths so the harness can drive
# both the present and the absent case against fixtures, non-root, without a
# real marker on the machine running the tests (repo precedent: the
# RIG_ROLE_MARKER gate in bin/rig, install.sh and users-close-root.sh).
