Box TENANT roles — what a box-minted guest becomes. box mints the thin,
creds-free seed (base image, user, rig preinstalled); this converges the
tenant on top, and re-runs converge an existing box to a new spec.

  claude|codex|grok   the agent tenants: base tooling (git, gh, tmux, …),
                      docker, the agent's CLI on the system PATH, and the
                      agent-context file — including the box#80 guard: never
                      run `box setup-host` or the drill inside a box.
  staging             the server tenant (box#69's posture): docker + sshd
                      hardening. The tailnet workload join is deliberately
                      NOT here — it holds a credential, so it stays
                      operator-run: `box shell` → `sudo rig bootstrap
                      workload-server` with a tagged pre-auth key.

  --user <name>       the tenant user the box seed created (default: the
                      role's name; staging defaults to `ops`)

Tenant roles are creds-free and non-interactive by contract — box auto-runs
them at mint (`box exec … rig bootstrap claude`). They take none of the
machine-role traits (--hostname/--class/--host/--join): a tenant is a guest,
not a tailnet machine. Run as root, inside the box.

# markers (repo precedent: the coolify marker warning). Two refusals, one
# tolerance:
#   - host=yes  → refuse, every tenant: a VM HOST is the opposite of a guest.
#     Names the staging rename out loud — before #31, `staging` was the VM-host
#     PRESET; that shape is now spelled through the traits.
#   - class= (agent tenants) → refuse: an agent box is never a tailnet machine.
#   - class=server with host=no (staging only) → PROCEED, and leave the marker
#     alone: that is the staging guest AFTER its operator-run workload join, and
#     re-converging docker+hardening on it is exactly what convergence is for.
