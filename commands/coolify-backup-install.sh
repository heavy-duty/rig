Installs a nightly dump of the Coolify control-plane database: pg_dump piped
straight into age (encrypted CLIENT-SIDE, on this box) and shipped to an
S3-compatible bucket. Control-plane box only. Run as root.

That database holds the GitHub App private key, every registered server's SSH
key, and every environment value for every environment this control plane
manages — which is why it is never written to disk or to S3 in the clear.

rig installs: age, awscli, /usr/local/sbin/coolify-dump.sh, a systemd service
+ timer, and an EMPTY 0600 bindings file at /etc/coolify-dump.env.

You supply, by filling that file and nothing else: the age recipient (a PUBLIC
key), the S3 bucket + endpoint, and the S3 credentials. Until you do, the unit
fails loudly on every run — the correct failure mode for a backup.

# absent, so WARN, never die, and warn before the root check so the harness can
# prove it non-root (RIG_ROLE_MARKER points it at fixtures, repo precedent).
# Matches the ROLE NAME, so #76's rename reaches it the same way it reaches
# `coolify install` — a pre-rename marker takes the warning branch, which is
# the hard cut behaving as designed rather than a regression.

# --- what rig deliberately did NOT do ----------------------------------------
cat <<EOF

rig-coolify-backup: installed. The timer is live but the backup does NOT work yet —
rig has no credentials and cannot verify an upload. Two steps remain, both yours:

  1. Fill in the bindings:  nano ${ENV_FILE}
     (age recipient = a PUBLIC key; S3 bucket, endpoint, access key, secret, region)
     S3_BUCKET must be an s3:// URI, not a bare bucket name.

  2. Run it once by hand — do NOT wait for the timer to find out:
       systemctl start coolify-dump.service
       journalctl -u coolify-dump.service -n 20 --no-pager

  3. Prove you can OPEN it. A successful upload only proves the file ARRIVED.
     If the recipient is the wrong key, every run succeeds forever and produces
     an artifact nobody can decrypt — and you cannot tell by looking at it.
     From a machine holding the private key (NEVER this box), stream it down
     and decrypt; you want PostgreSQL SQL out the other end:

       ssh root@$(hostname) 'set -a; . ${ENV_FILE}; set +a; \\
         line=\$(aws s3 ls "\$S3_BUCKET/" --endpoint-url "\$S3_ENDPOINT" | sort | tail -1); \\
         aws s3 cp "\$S3_BUCKET/\${line##* }" - --endpoint-url "\$S3_ENDPOINT"' \\
         | age -d -i <your-key-file> | { head -5; cat >/dev/null; }

     A backup you have never read back is not yet a backup.

Until step 1 is done the unit fails loudly on every run. That is deliberate — a
silent backup is worse than a missing one.
