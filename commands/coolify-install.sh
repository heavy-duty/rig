# --- role-marker sanity (issue #25) ------------------------------------------
# Coolify belongs on the control-plane box and nowhere else — but the marker is
# ADVISORY, never a gate. It may legitimately be absent (a box bootstrapped
# before rig wrote markers, or a hand-built one), and rig refuses to guess from
# silence. When the marker EXISTS and names another role, the likeliest story
# is an operator in the wrong SSH session about to put a control plane on a
# workload box — so say it loudly. But WARN, never die: the operator may also
# be deliberately repurposing the box, and an advisory file must never outrank
# the human running the command (contrast close-root, where the marker IS the
# gate — shutting the root door blind is irreversible in a way an extra
# Coolify is not). Placed BEFORE the root check for the same reason arg errors
# are: the harness proves it non-root, and reading a 0644 file needs no
# privilege. RIG_ROLE_MARKER overrides the path so tests point it at fixtures
# (repo precedent: users-apply, users-close-root).
#
# This match is on the ROLE NAME, which #76's rename therefore reaches: a box
# bootstrapped before the rename carries 'role=control-plane' and now takes the
# warning branch. That is the hard cut behaving as designed — the marker is
# advisory, the run still proceeds, and the warning names the re-bootstrap that
# makes the marker true again. Nothing here is load-bearing enough to justify
# carrying the old name forever.
