# labels-reconcile.sh — the automation LABELS.md promises: state labels are
# written by machinery, never by hand. Every run derives each open PR's
# state:* from GitHub's own facts (draft flag, requested reviewers, submitted
# reviews) and converges the labels to it, so a killed run or a hand-moved
# label heals on the next pass. Stale is judged from real activity — commits,
# comments, reviews — never from label churn, or the sweep would un-stale its
# own mark every tick.
#
# The verdict contract (CONTRIBUTING.md): reviews end in approve or
# request-changes. Some live bots are comment-only and post agreement as a
# COMMENTED review — a non-verdict this machine refuses to guess about (body
# parsing is a heuristic, and a wrong guess promotes an unapproved PR). The
# judgment call belongs to the PR AUTHOR, who reads the round and escalates
# by requesting the human's review — an explicit request is a fact, and it is
# the one this machine trusts (see decide_state's top precedence). The
# machine auto-requests the human only in the no-judgment-needed case: three
# formal head-current approvals. Any approval that counts must be bound to
# the CURRENT head SHA: GitHub keeps approvals alive across pushes, and a
# stale approval must never promote unreviewed code to the human.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 narrates every mutation instead of performing it (how this script
# is rehearsed against the live repo). A workflow_dispatch run also bootstraps
# the taxonomy (label create --force) — that heal is dispatch-only; the cron
# sweep tolerates a missing label rather than recreating it.
#
# The state machine below is pure (globals in, state out) and covered by
# fixture tests in test/labels-reconcile.sh.

  # The rollup mixes two node types with two different closed enums: CheckRun
  # carries `conclusion` (CheckConclusionState), StatusContext carries `state`
  # (StatusState). Rather than list the outcomes that block — the version that
  # shipped in this PR's first round listed four, and ERROR, CANCELLED and
  # STALE fell through its `else` into SUCCESS — this lists the outcomes that
  # DON'T, and treats everything else as blocking.
  #
  # That direction is the point. An outcome we do not recognise is one we
  # cannot certify as mergeable, and certifying the unrecognised as green is
  # the exact shape of #136. The cost of being wrong is symmetric in form and
  # not in consequence: a false FAILURE parks the PR on the agent, who looks;
  # a false SUCCESS invites a human to merge a tree that will not merge.
  jq -r '
    # NEUTRAL and SKIPPED satisfy branch protection — a skipped required check
    # is not a failed one, and path-filtered jobs skip constantly here.
    ["SUCCESS", "NEUTRAL", "SKIPPED"] as $passing
    # "" covers a StatusContext still reported with no state at all.
    | ["", "PENDING", "IN_PROGRESS", "QUEUED", "WAITING", "REQUESTED", "EXPECTED"] as $waiting

    # A re-run does not evict the run it superseded — the rollup keeps both.
    # This PR proved it: its own tip carried a CANCELLED `scope` (15:19:39)
    # beside the SUCCESS `scope` (15:19:45) that replaced it, same workflow.
    # Once CANCELLED blocks, judging every entry would strand this very PR in
    # needs-rebase forever, so collapse each context to its newest entry first.
    # Key on workflow + name because a bare job name is only unique within its
    # workflow.
    #
    # Dating a run is the subtle part, and getting it wrong restores the bug.
    # A run still in flight has no completion, but `gh` does not omit the
    # field: its Go struct marshals the zero time as "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    # which is a string, so `//` will not fall through it. Ordering on
    # completion therefore sorted the LIVE re-run to the bottom and let `last`
    # pick the very run it superseded — reporting the old SUCCESS while a
    # replacement was still running, which is #136 again.
    #
    # So: date a run by when it BEGAN, discarding both spellings of absent
    # (null, and the zero sentinel), and fall back only if it never recorded a
    # beginning. Deliberately `first` over the preference-ordered list and not
    # `max` of it: max mixes "when it started" with "when it ended", which are
    # different quantities, so it is not an ordering on runs at all. A run
    # cancelled by the concurrency group does not stop the instant its
    # replacement starts — the runner has to receive the signal and wind down —
    # so predecessor.completedAt > successor.startedAt is the ordinary case
    # (13s on the box#137 tip), and under max the dying predecessor
    # out-dated its live replacement for the whole drain window.
    #
    # An entry that carries no usable timestamp at all sorts LAST rather than
    # first — something we cannot date is most likely the thing just created,
    # and treating it as newest keeps an undateable in-flight run from being
    # discarded in favour of a stale success. Every ambiguity here resolves
    # toward "not settled".
