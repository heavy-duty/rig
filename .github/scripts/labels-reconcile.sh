# labels-reconcile.sh — the automation LABELS.md promises: state labels are
# written by machinery, never by hand. Every run derives each open PR's
# state:* from GitHub's own facts (draft flag, requested reviewers, submitted
# reviews) and converges the labels to it, so a killed run or a hand-moved
# label heals on the next pass. Stale is judged from real activity — commits,
# comments, reviews — never from label churn, or the sweep would un-stale its
# own mark every tick.
#
# The verdict contract (CONTRIBUTING.md): reviews end in approve or
# request-changes. Some live bots are comment-only and post agreement as a
# COMMENTED review — a non-verdict this machine refuses to guess about (body
# parsing is a heuristic, and a wrong guess promotes an unapproved PR). The
# judgment call belongs to the PR AUTHOR, who reads the round and escalates
# by requesting the human's review — an explicit request is a fact, and it is
# the one this machine trusts (see decide_state's top precedence). The
# machine auto-requests the human only in the no-judgment-needed case: three
# formal head-current approvals. Any approval that counts must be bound to
# the CURRENT head SHA: GitHub keeps approvals alive across pushes, and a
# stale approval must never promote unreviewed code to the human.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 narrates every mutation instead of performing it (how this script
# is rehearsed against the live repo). A workflow_dispatch run also bootstraps
# the taxonomy (label create --force) — that heal is dispatch-only; the cron
# sweep tolerates a missing label rather than recreating it.
#
# The state machine below is pure (globals in, state out) and covered by
# fixture tests in test/labels-reconcile.sh.
