# Changelog

History before 0.1.0 lives in git — rig grew its version surface (`VERSION`,
`rig --version`, the side-by-side `versions/<v>` install layout; #35/#36)
on the way to cutting its first release, and this file starts there.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **The release suite accepts the ceremony's own tree** (#44) —
  `test/release.sh` demanded a literal `## Unreleased` heading in the real
  `CHANGELOG.md`, extracting non-empty and containing `#32`. All three are
  false by construction on the `release: X.Y.Z` tree the ceremony's own PR
  produces (it stamps that heading into `## X.Y.Z — date`), so the first
  real release PR turned CI red and the flow blocked itself — invisible to
  both fork rehearsals, which tag a branch (`release.yml` runs; `ci.yml`
  never does). The guard now asserts what it was for: whatever the TOP
  `## ` section is — `Unreleased` between releases, the stamped version on
  and right after one — the exact `changelog_section` the workflow runs
  extracts it non-empty. The rotting issue-number grep is gone.

- **Headless credential prompts refuse loudly instead of dying silently**
  (#42) — the interactive credential prompts (`TS_AUTHKEY` in `bootstrap`,
  `RUNNER_TOKEN` in `runner install`, `RUNNER_REMOVE_TOKEN` in
  `runner remove`, and both tokens in `runner repoint` — a site the new
  no-bare-read test caught after the issue counted three) were bare
  `read -rsp`: with stdin not a tty (CI,
  `box exec`, any script), `read` fails, `set -e` ends the run, and the
  log just *stops* — exit 1, no last word, measured live in the
  2026-07-19 release drill. Each prompt now checks for a tty first and
  dies naming the variable that unblocks an unattended run (`runner
  remove` also names `--local`), and every `read` is `|| die`-guarded so
  EOF at a real prompt gets the same courtesy. `db.sh` already held the
  line here; now all of rig does.

### Added

- **Merging a release-labeled PR IS the release — and the release re-arms
  main itself** (#47) — the rig twin of heavy-duty/box#96, born of the
  ceremony retro: the tag was a separate, manual, silent-when-forgotten
  step, and a forgotten tag produces no red X. `release.yml` now fires on
  pushes to main (fork-sourced ceremony PRs get a read-only token on
  `pull_request` events), reading the transition from the push itself:
  `event.before` to the pushed head. A decide step answers four states —
  release-flow *work* merged under the `release` label (`-dev` endstates,
  the post-release window) no-ops green with a NOTICE; the two genuinely
  ambiguous bare states refuse loudly; a true transition then requires a
  merged, `release`-labeled PR behind the commit (read via the API — the
  label is the operator's declared intent). Then, in the same job, it
  API-creates the tag at the merge commit, publishes with the extracted
  notes — and bumps main to `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev` itself, direct push with a
  loud open-a-PR fallback, so no follow-up bump PR exists on the paved
  road. A `GITHUB_TOKEN`-created tag never fires the tag-push trigger, so
  the paths cannot double-publish — and that tag-push path survives intact
  as the documented manual fallback and backfill.

- **Tagged releases, and an installer that installs them** (#32) — the rig
  half of the flow designed in heavy-duty/box#83, near-verbatim. A release
  is a PR, then a tag: the `release: X.Y.Z` PR bumps `VERSION` and stamps
  this file's Unreleased section with version + date; the merge commit is
  tagged bare `X.Y.Z` (box's tag scheme — no `v` prefix). `release.yml`
  turns the tag into the GitHub release — after asserting tag == `VERSION`
  (mismatch fails loudly and creates nothing) — with that version's section
  of this file as the body, extracted by the same `changelog_section` the
  test harness drives. No assets: for a pure-bash tree, GitHub's source
  tarball for the tag IS the package. `install.sh` now defaults to the
  **latest release**: the tag is resolved by following the
  `releases/latest` redirect and reading the `Location` header — no API, no
  token — and the download is `archive/refs/tags/<tag>.tar.gz`. `RIG_REF`
  picks the other two channels: a tag pins (`refs/tags` outranks a
  same-named branch), a branch (`RIG_REF=main`) tracks the development
  tree. Until 0.1.0 is cut the default channel has nothing to resolve and
  dies saying exactly that, naming `RIG_REF=main` as the way to install
  today — it never falls back to main silently, because "I installed the
  latest release" must not quietly mean "I installed whatever main was that
  second". Step 5 of #32 — pinning `BOX_REF` in the host-installs-box path
  — stays open until box cuts its next tagged release.
