# drill/drill.sh — rig's release drill: the instrument behind drills/README.md.
#
#   ⚠ DESTRUCTIVE, AND MEANT TO BE. Run it on a THROWAWAY Debian machine you
#     can format. It wipes any installed rig and reinstalls from the pinned
#     ref, hardens sshd, sets the hostname, joins the tailnet, installs box
#     and its Incus stack, installs Coolify and a GitHub Actions runner.
#     Never run it on a machine you care about.
#
#   TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-... bash drill/drill.sh \
#     --rig-ref release/0.4.0 --box-ref 0.9.0 \
#     --users ./drill-users --run-id drill-2026-07-24-a \
#     --coolify-version 4.1.2 --runner-repo you/rig --yes
#   (--box-ref is a tag: since #103 the box that ships is the BOX_RELEASE tag.)
# rig's drill asserts CONVERGENCE — a machine reaches its role, idempotently.
# The legs (drills/README.md, issue #105):
#
#   1. convergence + idempotence — `rig bootstrap <role> --users <path>`
#      reaches the declared role; a re-run produces an EMPTY state diff,
#      mechanically, never by eye. Rides along: the --host yes assertions
#      (the pinned box installed, its host stack stands — and it STOPS there;
#      the isolation boundary is box's drill's assertion, not this one's).
#   2. db — the real dump/restore round-trip, test/db-integration.sh.
#   3. runner lifecycle — register, take a job, deregister, against a fork.
#   4. coolify install — at a pinned version, AUTOUPDATE=false.
#
# Execution order is 1, 4, 2, 3 — coolify's installer is what puts Docker on
# the box, and leg 2 needs a daemon; running db before coolify would skip a
# leg this same run makes runnable. The record lists legs as they ran.
#
# Exit 0 = no check failed. A FAILED drill still emits a complete record —
# the gate wants evidence, not success — and skipped legs are counted and
# named, never folded into the passes (heavy-duty/box#153's defect class).
#
# The file is one long 'probe && ok "…" || no "…"'. ok/no always return 0, so
# the C-may-run-when-A-is-true trap SC2015 warns about cannot fire here.
# shellcheck disable=SC2015
#
# NOT -e: a failing check is data, not a crash — a drill that aborts on its
# first failure reports one problem per afternoon. NOT pipefail: checks of the
# 'refusal 2>&1 | grep -q text' shape have a left side that exits non-zero BY
# DESIGN, and 'grep -q' SIGPIPEs the left side on early match — box's first
# live run turned both into false FAILs. The pipeline verdict must be grep's
# alone. (box drill/drill.sh's header, the discipline #105 prescribes.)
