# rig installer — intended for: curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash

# Three channels from this one script (heavy-duty/rig#32; box#83's design):
#
#   RIG_REF unset      the latest RELEASE — the tag is resolved from the
#                      releases/latest redirect, the download is that tag's
#                      source tarball (which IS the package)
#   RIG_REF=<tag>      that release, pinned (a tag outranks a branch of the
#                      same name)
#   RIG_REF=<branch>   the development tree, e.g. RIG_REF=main
#
# Downloads the rig repo tarball and installs it into the VERSIONED layout
# under $DEST (box#79's layout, ported — heavy-duty/rig#35):
#
#   $DEST/versions/<version>/    one full tree per installed version
#   $DEST/current -> versions/<version>       the default version
#   $BINDIR/rig   -> $DEST/current/bin/rig    the PATH entry
#
# Versions install side by side: `rig versions` lists them, `rig use <v>`
# switches the default, `rig uninstall` removes them. Re-running with an
# already-installed version is a converging no-op (RIG_REINSTALL=1 replaces
# that version's tree); a NEW version installs beside the old one and becomes
# the default — with a WARNING when this host is bootstrapped (/etc/rig/role
# exists), because switching the rig under a converged host changes what a
# re-converge would do. rig warns where box refuses: rig has no boxes to
# protect, and the operator flipping versions on purpose is the common case.
# A pre-versioning flat tree is migrated in place, so upgrading is seamless.
#
# RIG_INSTALL_SOURCE=<dir-or-tarball> is the LOCAL channel, a supported input
# like RIG_REF (#106): installs from that tree instead of downloading — CI's
# install-lifecycle job and the test suites use it, so what lands is the code
# under review. A path that is neither refuses by name, never falls back to
# a download.
